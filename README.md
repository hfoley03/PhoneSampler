# SystemAudioRecorderMobileApp

## To Do:

Settings page ->  opened from setting sbutton on record page, should allow user to change some settings, 
                  example seetings: turning on/off the automatic trimming,
                      setting the automatic naming prefix, 
                      audio quality, 
                      stereo vs mono, 

fix UI issues - should have same look and feel on each page
              - dark more show be dark, light mode light
              - all buttons on all pages should be equally and symetrically spread, especially check for in landscape

fix bug -> when the app asks for permission to record audio before each recording, if you press cancel the app crashes

edit recording screen -> add a pop up confiriming that a sample has been trimmed after pressing trim

recording list -> we have 3 buttons on each card (delete, rename, upload) these should be replace by 1 three dot button, on pressing the 3 dot button the delete rename upload buttons should appear in a pop up, could add also add the share button into the three dot button

recording list -> would be nice to be able to multi select and then delete or share etc

record screen -> keep animation but make it more background and transparent. on top of it add a recording timer display, and the word ready (when not recording) / recording ( when recording)

record screen -> when recording, the record button should turn into an X, if user presses X than recording is stopped, file deleted, no pop up to name and not added to database
